      "title": "AI-Driven Smart Contract Optimization in Financial Derivatives",
      "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into decentralized finance (DeFi) has triggered a paradigm shift in the automation and optimization of financial contracts, particularly within the domain of financial derivatives. Derivatives, including options, futures, swaps, and forwards, are among the most complex financial instruments, requiring accurate pricing, efficient settlement, and continuous risk monitoring. Smart contracts\u2014self-executing agreements coded onto blockchain networks\u2014have emerged as a transformative mechanism to automate these processes. However, conventional smart contracts in DeFi are constrained by inefficiencies in execution logic, gas costs, vulnerability to adversarial trading strategies, and limitations in adapting to real-time market fluctuations. \nThis manuscript investigates AI-driven optimization frameworks for smart contracts in derivatives markets, where machine learning algorithms, reinforcement learning agents, and predictive analytics are employed to dynamically enhance pricing mechanisms, counterparty risk management, and execution efficiency. The study builds on an extensive literature review of DeFi, AI-finance integration, and blockchain automation, proposing an AI-augmented smart contract architecture that enables adaptive fee structures, risk-adjusted margin calls, automated dispute resolution, and latency-sensitive derivatives clearing. \nA simulation-based methodology was employed, where deep reinforcement learning models interacted with synthetic market data to optimize contract logic in futures and options markets deployed on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchains. Statistical evaluation revealed that AI-enhanced smart contracts demonstrated 25\u201340% improvement in transaction throughput, 18\u201325% reduction in gas costs, 30\u201335% enhancement in derivative pricing accuracy, and 50% reduction in settlement disputes compared to baseline blockchain contracts. \nThe results highlight that AI-driven optimization is not only feasible but essential for scaling derivatives trading in DeFi to institutional-grade levels. The paper concludes by discussing regulatory implications, computational limitations, adversarial AI threats, and the future trajectory of autonomous financial engineering.",

      "title": "Reinforcement-Learning Portfolio Allocation with Dynamic Embedding of Market Information",
      "abstract": "We develop a portfolio allocation framework that leverages deep learning techniques to address challenges arising from high-dimensional, non-stationary, and low-signal-to-noise market information. Our approach includes a dynamic embedding method that reduces the non-stationary, high-dimensional state space into a lower-dimensional representation. We design a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates generative autoencoders and online meta-learning to dynamically embed market information, enabling the RL agent to focus on the most impactful parts of the state space for portfolio allocation decisions. Empirical analysis based on the top 500 U.S. stocks demonstrates that our framework outperforms common portfolio benchmarks and the predict-then-optimize (PTO) approach using machine learning, particularly during periods of market stress. Traditional factor models do not fully explain this superior performance. The framework's ability to time volatility reduces its market exposure during turbulent times. Ablation studies confirm the robustness of this performance across various reinforcement learning algorithms. Additionally, the embedding and meta-learning techniques effectively manage the complexities of high-dimensional, noisy, and non-stationary financial data, enhancing both portfolio performance and risk management.",

These techniques are evaluated on varied financial datasets. Results demonstrate DRL's effectiveness in revealing patterns, capturing complex relationships, and adapting to market dynamics. The DRL algorithms consistently outperform traditional optimization methods lacking adaptive learning. The DRL-Portfolio framework, implemented using these algorithms, showcases dynamic portfolio optimization across stock indices.

      "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic exploration of deep reinforcement learning (RL) for portfolio optimization and compares various agent architectures, such as the DQN, DDPG, PPO, and SAC. We evaluate these agents\u2019 performance across multiple market signals, including OHLC price data and technical indicators, while incorporating different rebalancing frequencies and historical window lengths. This study uses six major financial indices and a risk-free asset as the core instruments. Our results show that CNN-based feature extractors, particularly with longer lookback periods, significantly outperform MLP models, providing superior risk-adjusted returns. DQN and DDPG agents consistently surpass market benchmarks, such as the S&P 500, in annualized returns. However, continuous rebalancing leads to higher transaction costs and slippage, making periodic rebalancing a more efficient approach to managing risk. This research offers valuable insights into the adaptability of RL agents to dynamic market conditions, proposing a robust framework for future advancements in financial machine learning.",

      "title": "Optimization of High-Frequency Trading Strategies Using Deep Reinforcement Learning",
      "abstract": "This study presents a new method for optimising high-risk trading (HFT) strategies using deep learning (DRL). We propose a multi-time DRL framework integrating advanced neural network architectures with sophisticated business data processing techniques. The framework employs a combination of convolutional neural networks for manual order analysis, short-term memory networks for time series processing, and a multi-head listening mechanism for body fusion. We formulate the HFT problem based on Markov Decision Processes and use the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm for training. The model is evaluated using tick-by-tick data from the NASDAQ exchange, including ten liquid stocks in 6 months. The experimental results show the superiority of our method, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 3.42, outperforming the learning model and machine learning based on benchmarks up to 33%. The proposed strategy has demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of regulatory markets and has shown potential for strategic objectives. Sensitivity analysis confirms the model's stability across a range of hyperparameters. Our findings suggest that the DRL-based approach can improve HFT performance and provide better market adaptation and risk management. This research leads to the continuous evolution of algorithmic trading strategies and shows the potential of AI-driven approaches in financial markets.",

      "abstract": "Traditional strategies for managing portfolios often rely on rigid models and people\u2019s gut feelings, which might not work as well when the market is changing and unclear. Instead, DRL seems like a good way to make decisions that are adaptable because it learns from past data and interacts with the market environment. A system that combines DRL algorithms with financial data is what we\u2019re suggesting as the best way to make trade and stock allocation decisions. By changing stock weights based on market signs and past success, the DRL robot learns how to get the most total benefits. We show that our method works by doing a lot of back testing on old market data and comparing it to other strategies that have been used before. In terms of risk-adjusted returns and ability to handle market instability, our DRL-based portfolio management plan does better than standard approaches. We also look at how different hyper-parameters and design choices affect how well the DRL agent works. Overall, our study adds to the growing amount of research on using machine learning in financial markets and gives practitioners who want to improve portfolio management through automation and flexible decision-making useful information.",

      "title": "The Evolution of Portfolio Theory: Integrating Machine Learning with Markowitz Optimization",
      "abstract": "Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), developed by Harry Markowitz, transformed investment practices by wisely balancing risk and return. Nonetheless, its efficacy wanes in fluctuating financial markets due to its dependence on historical data and fixed assumptions. This paper investigates incorporating Machine Learning (ML) techniques into the traditional Markowitz optimization framework to enhance portfolio construction and risk management processes. It highlights the use of supervised learning for forecasting asset returns, unsupervised learning for asset clustering, and reinforcement learning for adjusting portfolios dynamically. An empirical analysis utilizing recent U.S. market data reveals that ML models improve risk assessment, asset selection, and adaptive portfolio allocation. Techniques such as linear regression, clustering algorithms, and principal component analysis (PCA) facilitate superior forecasting and portfolio design in various market environments. The research also shows that ML can enhance Sharpe ratios in specific market conditions compared to conventional MPT. ML increases portfolio flexibility and robustness by aligning predictive modeling with optimization objectives. This evolving methodology lays the foundation for a more responsive, data-informed investment strategy in today\u2019s finance, providing a viable alternative to the limitations of traditional models.",

Using these machines learning the methods, including the DRL algorithm, this program is designed to strengthen while making investment choices beyond the limits of the traditional framework, as well as enhancing the decision-making processes in an environment with many uncertainties and dynamics. The study begins with a literature review that is thorough and covers past works on traditional finance portfolio management, market prediction methods, and recent work on DRL in finance. Leveraging this base, we design and implement DRL-V-based models for asset management and market prediction situations. Empirical research includes the construction of models that use historical financial records about stock indexes and macroeconomic data as the main input. We use some of the performance metrics like cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and annualized volatility as the KPIs. We compare them with historical data along with the DRL model\u2019s performance and other baseline models as well.

However, the inherent complexity and unpredictability of financial markets pose a challenge. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), offer promising solutions by enabling dynamic and adaptive trading strategies. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of three actor-critic-based DRL algorithms-Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-applied to portfolio optimization. These strategies were implemented in both sentiment-aware and non-sentiment-aware versions, allowing for a direct comparison of their performance. The sentiment-aware models incorporated sentiment analysis using FinBERT and knowledge graphs to measure market sentiment from financial news, while the non-sentiment-aware models relied solely on stock prices and technical indicators. Our comparative study demonstrates that incorporating sentiment analysis resulted in consistently superior risk-adjusted returns and portfolio resilience during market fluctuations compared to non-sentiment-aware strategies.",

      "title": "Adaptive Trade Exception Handling in Financial Institutions: A Reinforcement Learning Approach with Dynamic Policy Optimization",
      "abstract": "Powerful trade execution systems have been mainly relied upon to manage transactions on financial institutions with ease. Still, the adverse market conditions as well as some system anomalies trigger adaptive exception handling of trades. This paper thus utilizes a reinforcement learning-based technique for dynamic optimization of policy for handling trade exceptions. The introduced model learns constantly from historical as well as real-time trade data in order to develop its skill of decision making, minimize false positives, and maximize operational effectiveness. Using machine learning algorithms such as Q-learning and DDPG, the system learns dynamically according to changes in the market and thus effectively handles trade exceptions. Our results were that adaptive reinforcement learning models are better than static rule-based systems in handling trade exception cases and thus may be considered as the scalable intelligent solution for financial organizations. This research casts a little light on the role of AI-driven automation in compliance monitoring, risk management, and trade surveillance.",

      "title": "The Synergistic Role of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning in Strengthening Cyber Security Measures for Crypto Currency Platforms",
      "abstract": "This study explores the role of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven cybersecurity models in mitigating fraud, smart contract vulnerabilities, and regulatory challenges in cryptocurrency platforms. Utilizing datasets such as the Elliptic Bitcoin Dataset, SolidiFI-Benchmark, CryptoScamDB, and CipherTrace AML Reports, this research employs Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fraud detection and anomaly identification. The AI-based security model demonstrates a 5.2% increase in fraud detection accuracy over traditional rule-based methods while reducing false positives by 19.3%. However, the model exhibits a false negative rate of 98.9%, indicating challenges in fully capturing sophisticated fraud techniques. Regression analysis shows a strong inverse correlation (R\u00b2 = 0.927) between AI adoption and fraud cases, where each 1% increase in AI adoption corresponds to a reduction of approximately 37 fraud cases.In real-world applicability, the proposed AI-driven models enhance scalability and real-time threat detection but require substantial computational resources, particularly for deep learning and RL-based techniques. Computational efficiency is optimized through federated learning and quantum-resistant AI security, ensuring robust yet privacy-preserving fraud detection. Despite its advantages, challenges such as adversarial AI attacks, regulatory inconsistencies, and scalability under high transaction loads persist.The study recommends self-supervised learning for fraud detection, improving interpretability in deep learning models, and developing AI-driven compliance frameworks to address ethical concerns. By integrating Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL), this study provides a novel approach to securing cryptocurrency transactions, offering actionable insights for researchers, financial institutions, and policymakers.",

      "title": "Trading BOT Using Reinforcement Learning Techniques",
      "abstract": "This study investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods to develop autonomous algorithmic trading strategies that dynamically adapt to market conditions. Using an Actor-Critic and policy-based framework within a custom trading environment built on OpenAI Gym, the AI agent learns optimal buy/sell actions from historical stock data spanning 2010 to 2025. Key financial constraints portfolio balance, transaction costs, and risk management are explicitly modeled to simulate realistic trading conditions. Multiple DRL algorithms, including Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and REINFORCE, are implemented and comparatively evaluated using metrics such as total returns, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and average episodic rewards. Our results provide insights into each model\u2019s strengths and practical viability, highlighting PPO\u2019s stability and SAC\u2019s exploration efficiency trade-offs. The system features visualization tools to elucidate portfolio dynamics and trading behavior. This comprehensive approach demonstrates DRL\u2019s potential to advance autonomous trading systems capable of optimizing financial performance under real-world constraints.",
