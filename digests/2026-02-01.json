      "title": "All That Glisters Is Not Gold: A Benchmark for Reference-Free Counterfactual Financial Misinformation Detection",
      "abstract": "We introduce RFC Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models on financial misinformation under realistic news. RFC Bench operates at the paragraph level and captures the contextual complexity of financial news where meaning emerges from dispersed cues. The benchmark defines two complementary tasks: reference free misinformation detection and comparison based diagnosis using paired original perturbed inputs. Experiments reveal a consistent pattern: performance is substantially stronger when comparative context is available, while reference free settings expose significant weaknesses, including unstable predictions and elevated invalid outputs. These results indicate that current models struggle to maintain coherent belief states without external grounding. By highlighting this gap, RFC Bench provides a structured testbed for studying reference free reasoning and advancing more reliable financial misinformation detection in real world settings.",

      "title": "Do Whitepaper Claims Predict Market Behavior? Evidence from Cryptocurrency Factor Analysis",
      "abstract": "Cryptocurrency projects articulate value propositions through whitepapers, making claims about functionality and technical capabilities. This study investigates whether these narratives align with observed market behavior. We construct a pipeline combining zero-shot NLP classification (BART-MNLI) with CP tensor decomposition to compare three spaces: (1) a claims matrix from 24 whitepapers across 10 semantic categories, (2) market statistics for 49 assets over two years of hourly data, and (3) latent factors from tensor decomposition (rank 2, 92.45% variance explained). Using Procrustes rotation and Tucker's congruence coefficient, we test alignment across 23 common entities.   Results show weak alignment: claims-statistics (phi=0.341, p=0.332), claims-factors (phi=0.077, p=0.747), and statistics-factors (phi=0.197, p<0.001). The statistics-factors significance validates our methodology, confirming the pipeline detects relationships when present. Inter-model validation with DeBERTa-v3 yields 32% exact agreement but 67% top-3 agreement. Cross-sectional analysis reveals heterogeneous contributions: NEAR, MKR, ATOM show positive alignment while ENS, UNI, Bitcoin diverge most. Excluding Bitcoin confirms results are not driven by market dominance.   We interpret findings as weak alignment between whitepaper narratives and market factor structure. Limited power (n=23) precludes distinguishing weak from no alignment, but strong alignment (phi>=0.70) can be confidently rejected. Implications for narrative economics and investment analysis are discussed.",
