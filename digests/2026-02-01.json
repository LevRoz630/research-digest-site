      "title": "When the Rules Change: Adaptive Signal Extraction via Kalman Filtering and Markov-Switching Regimes",
      "abstract": "Static linear models of order flow assume constant parameters, failing precisely when they are needed most: during periods of market stress and structural change. This paper proposes a dynamic, state-dependent framework for order flow signal extraction that adapts to shifting market conditions in the Korean stock market. Using daily transaction data from 2020--2024 covering 2,439 stocks and 2.79 million stock-day observations, we implement three complementary methodologies: (1) an Adaptive Kalman Filter where measurement noise variance is explicitly coupled to market volatility; (2) a three-state Markov-Switching model identifying Bull, Normal, and Crisis regimes; and (3) an Asymmetric Response Function capturing differential investor reactions to positive versus negative shocks. We find that foreign investor predictive power increases 8.9-fold during crisis periods relative to bull markets ($\u03b2_{crisis}=0.00204$ vs. $\u03b2_{bull}=0.00023$), while individual investors exhibit momentum-chasing behavior with 6.3 times stronger response to positive shocks. The integrated ``All-Weather'' strategy provides modest drawdown reduction during extreme market events, though challenges remain in the post-COVID high-rate environment.",

      "title": "Brownian ReLU(Br-ReLU): A New Activation Function for a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network",
      "abstract": "Deep learning models are effective for sequential data modeling, yet commonly used activation functions such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, and PReLU often exhibit gradient instability when applied to noisy, non-stationary financial time series. This study introduces BrownianReLU, a stochastic activation function induced by Brownian motion that enhances gradient propagation and learning stability in Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Using Monte Carlo simulation, BrownianReLU provides a smooth, adaptive response for negative inputs, mitigating the dying ReLU problem. The proposed activation is evaluated on financial time series from Apple, GCB, and the S&P 500, as well as LendingClub loan data for classification. Results show consistently lower Mean Squared Error and higher $R^2$ values, indicating improved predictive accuracy and generalization. Although ROC-AUC metric is limited in classification tasks, activation choice significantly affects the trade-off between accuracy and sensitivity, with Brownian ReLU and the selected activation functions yielding practically meaningful performance.",
