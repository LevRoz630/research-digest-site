      "title": "The Fourier estimator of spot volatility: Unbounded coefficients and jumps in the price process",
      "abstract": "In this paper we study the Fourier estimator of Malliavin and Mancino for the spot volatility. We establish the convergence of the trigonometric polynomial to the volatility's path in a setting that includes the following aspects. First, the volatility is required to satisfy a mild integrability condition, but otherwise allowed to be unbounded. Second, the price process is assumed to have cadlag paths, not necessarily continuous. We obtain convergence rates for the probability of a bad approximation in estimated coefficients, with a speed that allow to obtain an almost sure convergence and not just in probability in the estimated reconstruction of the volatility's path. This is a new result even in the setting of continuous paths. We prove that a rescaled trigonometric polynomial approximate the quadratic jump process.",

      "title": "Breaking the Dimensional Barrier: Dynamic Portfolio Choice with Parameter Uncertainty via Pontryagin Projection",
      "abstract": "We study continuous-time CRRA portfolio choice in diffusion markets with uncertain estimated coefficients. Nature draws a latent parameter from a given distribution and keeps it fixed; the investor cannot observe this parameter and must commit to a parameter-blind policy maximizing an ex-ante objective. We treat the uncertainty distribution as an inference-agnostic sampling input.   We develop a simulation-only two-stage solver. Stage 1 extends Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization (PG-DPO) by sampling parameters internally and computing gradients via backpropagation through time. Stage 2 performs an aggregated Pontryagin projection: it aggregates costates across the parameter distribution to enforce a deployable stationarity condition, yielding a structured correction amortized via interactive distillation.   We prove a uniform conditional BPTT-PMP correspondence and a residual-based policy-gap bound with explicit error terms. Experiments on high-dimensional Gaussian drift and factor-driven benchmarks show that projection stabilizes learning and accurately recovers analytic references, while a model-free PPO baseline remains far from the targets.",

      "title": "Non-Convex Portfolio Optimization via Energy-Based Models: A Comparative Analysis Using the Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library (THRML) for Index Tracking",
      "abstract": "Portfolio optimization under cardinality constraints transforms the classical Markowitz mean-variance problem from a convex quadratic problem into an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. This paper introduces a novel approach using THRML (Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library), a JAX-based library for building and sampling probabilistic graphical models that reformulates index tracking as probabilistic inference on an Ising Hamiltonian. Unlike traditional methods that seek a single optimal solution, THRML samples from the Boltzmann distribution of high-quality portfolios using GPU-accelerated block Gibbs sampling, providing natural regularization against overfitting.   We implement three key innovations: (1) dynamic coupling strength that scales inversely with market volatility (VIX), adapting diversification pressure to market regimes; (2) rebalanced bias weights prioritizing tracking quality over momentum for index replication; and (3) sector-aware post-processing ensuring institutional-grade diversification. Backtesting on a 100-stock S and P 500 universe from 2023 to 2025 demonstrates that THRML achieves 4.31 percent annualized tracking error versus 5.66 to 6.30 percent for baselines, while simultaneously generating 128.63 percent total return against the index total return of 79.61 percent. The Diebold-Mariano test confirms statistical significance with p less than 0.0001 across all comparisons. These results position energy-based models as a promising paradigm for portfolio construction, bridging statistical mechanics and quantitative finance.",
