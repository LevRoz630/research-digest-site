      "title": "Optimal strategy and deep hedging for share repurchase programs",
      "abstract": "In recent decades, companies have frequently adopted share repurchase programs to return capital to shareholders or for other strategic purposes, instructing investment banks to rapidly buy back shares on their behalf. When the executing institution is allowed to hedge its exposure, it encounters several challenges due to the intrinsic features of the product. Moreover, contractual clauses or market regulations on trading activity may make it infeasible to rely on Greeks. In this work, we address the hedging of these products by developing a machine-learning framework that determines the optimal execution of the buyback while explicitly accounting for the bank's actual trading capabilities. This unified treatment of execution and hedging yields substantial performance improvements, resulting in an optimized policy that provides a feasible and realistic hedging approach. The pricing of these programs can be framed in terms of the discount that banks offer to the client on the price at which the shares are delivered. Since, in our framework, risk measures serve as objective functions, we exploit the concept of indifference pricing to compute this discount, thereby capturing the actual execution performance.",

      "title": "Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Rare-Event Simulation",
      "abstract": "Standard rare-event simulation techniques require exact distributional specifications, which limits their effectiveness in the presence of distributional uncertainty. To address this, we develop a novel framework for estimating rare-event probabilities subject to such distributional model risk. Specifically, we focus on computing worst-case rare-event probabilities, defined as a distributionally robust bound against a Wasserstein ambiguity set centered at a specific nominal distribution. By exploiting a dual characterization of this bound, we propose Distributionally Robust Importance Sampling (DRIS), a computationally tractable methodology designed to substantially reduce the variance associated with estimating the dual components. The proposed method is simple to implement and requires low sampling costs. Most importantly, it achieves vanishing relative error, the strongest efficiency guarantee that is notoriously difficult to establish in rare-event simulation. Our numerical studies confirm the superior performance of DRIS against existing benchmarks.",

      "title": "Second Thoughts: How 1-second subslots transform CEX-DEX Arbitrage on Ethereum",
      "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of reducing Ethereum slot time on decentralized exchange activity, with a focus on CEX-DEX arbitrage behavior. We develop a trading model where the agent's DEX transaction is not guaranteed to land, and the agent explicitly accounts for this execution risk when deciding whether to pursue arbitrage opportunities. We compare agent behavior under Ethereum's default 12-second slot time environment with a faster regime that offers 1-second subslot execution. The simulations, calibrated to Binance and Uniswap v3 data from July to September 2025, show that faster slot times increase arbitrage transaction count by 535% and trading volume by 203% on average. The increase in CEX-DEX arbitrage activity under 1-second subslots is driven by the reduction in variance of both successful and failed trade outcomes, increasing the risk-adjusted returns and making CEX-DEX arbitrage more appealing.",
